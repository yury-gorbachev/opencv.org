<p>We are glad to announce that OpenCV 4.0 Release candidate is now available, which includes many new features and enhancements. Along with this new library, are new open source tools to help fast-track high performance computer vision development and deep learning inference in OpenVINO™ toolkit (Open Visual Inference and Neural Network Optimization). More details about these releases and where to download follow.</p>

<h3>OpenCV 4.0 RC — What’s New</h3>

<p>OpenCV 4.0 RC includes 59 new patches, including massive merges from 3.4 branch, since OpenCV 4.0 beta (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-10-16-opencv-4-0-0-beta.html %}" >{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-10-16-opencv-4-0-0-beta.html %}</a>):
<ul>
<li>Vulcan backend for OpenCV DNN module</li>
<li>Improved stithing</li>
<li>Improved camera calibraion</li>
<li>Improved Graph API module  - initial heterogenity support, OpenCL support, documentation, standalone build</li>
<li>New C++ persistence implementation</li>
<li>more C-API cleanup</li>
<li>dropped obsolete videoio and highgui backends: QuickTime, QTKit, Unicap, Video for Windows, libv4l, DC1394_V1, Carbon</li>
<li>shape, superres, videostab and viz modules moved to opencv_contrib, TVL1 optical flow algorithm moved to opencv_contrib</li>
